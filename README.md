# Hello, Arion Fund!

Thank you for the interesting task. I got incredible pleasure doing it. Now I want to tell you how to run my solution.
### `npm i`

The command installs all the necessary dependencies.

The project was written in TypeScript, because I'm used to writing in TypeScript and prefer it to JavaSctipt. But of course I can write on pure JS.

Sometimes Image API doesn't return an image, but I think, it's not a problem and all solution work correct.

In project I use **Redux** as state-manager, **styledComponent** as CSS-in-JS library. Also i added **react-infinite-scroll-component** library for creating infinity scroll. 
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
